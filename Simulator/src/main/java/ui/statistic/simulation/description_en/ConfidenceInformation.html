<p>
The measured average values for reachability, waiting times, etc.
always refer to the simulation runs carried out. The concrete simulation
realizations, however, represent only some of the possible realizations
that can result on the basis of the model parameters, so that the actual
average values that result on the basis of the model parameters can differ
from the simulation results.
</p>
<p>
Confidence intervals indicate the probability of the actual average value
being within a range of the average value determined by simulation. The
higher the required probability (also called confidence level), the larger
the intervals. A higher number of repetitions of the simulation day leads
to smaller confidence intervals, that is, the location of the actual
average value can be better delimited.
