This statistics page shows the most important parameters for the
client groups included in the model. A distinction is made between
<b>calls</b> and <b>clients</b>. If a client has to call three times
in order to be successfully served, this represents an availability
of 100% on a client basis, but only an availability of 33% on a call basis.
