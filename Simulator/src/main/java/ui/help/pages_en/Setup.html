<h1>Dialog "Preferences"</h1>

<p>
The preferences dialog consists of 6 dialog pages through which the main operating parameters of the simulator can be configured:
</p>

<h2>User interface <img src="../images/application_go.png"></h2>
<p>
On this dialog page you can set which processing steps are to perform at startup:
</p>

<h3>Program language</h3>
<p>
This combo box can be used to set whether the user interface of the simulator is
to be displayed in English or in German.
</p>

<h3>Menu mode</h3>
<p>
The simulator can offer the functions for loading and storing data, running simulations and optimizations etc.
in form of classical menus and a toolbar as well as in form of a thematic ribbon bar.
In this dropdown box you can select which representation you prefer.
<br>(Default value is "Ribbon mode".)
</p>

<h3>Font sizes</h3>
<p>
From this combox box the font sizes (and hence the dialog window sizes)
can be configured for an optimal readability.
Changing the font sizes will take effect after a restart of the program.
<br>(Default font size is "Normal".)
</p>

<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>
In Java (depending on the used operating system) different themes for styling the graphical
program interface are available. This field can be used to select the theme to be used.
</p>
<p>
(The default is "System default", i.e. styling the program in the form intended for native programs.)
</p>

<h3>Window size on program start</h3>
<p>
The simulator can be displayed at startup as a normal window or as a 
full screen window. If you want the simulator run as a full screen
windows right after start up to you do not need to maximize the
windowso you can switch from "Default window size" to "Full screen".
If the option "Restore last window size" is selected, the simulator
will save the window size when the program is closed and will
restore it on next program start.
<br>(Default value is "Default window size".)
</p>

<h3>Load model on program start</h3>
<p>
To help you getting started with the Callcenter Simulator, the simulator can directly
load a built-in demo model with example data at startup. This allows to directly start
with some first tests without needing to define an entrie model from the scratch. Later
the starting model can be adjusted successively. The simulator provides eight options,
what should be displayed in the model editor when the program starts:
</p>
<ul class="big">
  <li><b>Empty model</b><br>
  Opens only the empty model editor without any caller groups and call centers.
  Before a simulation run can be started, clients, call centers, agents and skill levels 
  need to be defined or a previous saved model need to be loaded.</li>
  <li><b>Small example model</b><br>
  Loads at startup a small call center model consisting of 1,900 fresh calls and one call center.
  If this option is used, right after starting the program a simulation run can be
  started by clicking the "Run simulation" button.</li>
  <li><b>Medium example model</b><br>
  Loads at startup a medium call center model consisting of 30,000 fresh calls and three call centers.  
  If this option is used, right after starting the program a simulation run can be
  started by clicking the "Run simulation" button.</li>
  <li><b>Large example model</b><br>
  Loads at startup a large call center model consisting of 100,000 fresh calls and four call centers.
  If this option is used, right after starting the program a simulation run can be
  started by clicking the "Run simulation" button.</li>
  <li><b>Very lange example model</b><br>
  Loads at startup a very large call center model consisting of 300,000 fresh calls and four call centers.
  If this option is used, right after starting the program a simulation run can be
  started by clicking the "Run simulation" button.</li>
  <li><b>Kleines Erlang-C-Beispielmodell</b><br>
  Loads at startup a small call center model consisting of 1,872 fresh calls and one call centers.
  The model uses some unrealistic assumptions which allow to completely
  describe the model by the Erlang C formula, so simulation and analytical
  results can be compared.  
  If this option is used, right after starting the program a simulation run can be
  started by clicking the "Run simulation" button.</li>  
  <li><b>Mittleres Erlang-C-Beispielmodell</b><br>
  Loads at startup a medium call center model consisting of 27,360 fresh calls and one call centers.
  The model uses some unrealistic assumptions which allow to completely
  describe the model by the Erlang C formula, so simulation and analytical
  results can be compared.
  If this option is used, right after starting the program a simulation run can be
  started by clicking the "Run simulation" button.</li>
  <li><b>Groﬂes Erlang-C-Beispielmodell</b><br>
  Loads at startup a medium call center model consisting of 144,000 fresh calls and one call centers.
  The model uses some unrealistic assumptions which allow to completely
  describe the model by the Erlang C formula, so simulation and analytical
  results can be compared.
  If this option is used, right after starting the program a simulation run can be
  started by clicking the "Run simulation" button.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Default value is "Small example model".)</p>

<h3>Show welcome page on program start</h3>
<p>
The Callcenter Simulator can display a welcome page at startup
that provides links to various help topics and thus allows an easy entry
into the use of the simulator. Alternatively the simulator can
skip the welcome page and directly display the model editor.
<br>(As the default value the welcome page will be displayed.)
</p>

<h3>Check installed Java version and warn if outdated and insecure</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, at each startup the simulator will check
if the installed Java version is outdated (based on the latest version
at build time of the Callcenter Simulator). The there are newer Java
versions than the installed version an information bar will appear
in the program window for a few seconds.
<br>(As the default value the version check is activated.)
</p>

<h2>Simulation <img src="../images/action_go.gif"></h2>

<h3>Strict model check</h3>
<p>
On this dialog page via the checkbox "Strict model check" can be selected if a strict or a fault-tolerant model check is to be
performed before the start of the simulation. The following list shows the differences between the strict and fault-tolerant check:
</p>
<ul class="big">
  <li>In strict mode invalid <b>retry probabilites</b> of the clients will lead a stop of the simulation. Invalid entries
  are considered to be an oversight of the user and it is believed that it is better not to start the simulation with an incorrect model.
  In fault-tolerant mode invalid retry probabilites are interpreted as "0".</li>
  <li>In strict mode the simulation is canceled if clients are to be <b>forwarded</b> to client types that do not exists
  or if the forwarding rates to some client types are negative. Both are considered to be an oversight of the user and
  it is believed that it is better not to start the simulation with an incorrect model.
  In fault-tolerant mode invalid forwarding rates (due to not existing target client types or due to negative values) are interpreted as "0".</li>  
  <li>In strict mode each <b>call center</b> has to have a namen. In fault-tolerant mode call centers without a name
  are reported as "unnamed call center" in the statistics.</li>
  <li>In strict mode the <b>technical free time</b> has to be non-negative. Values les than 0 are considered to be an
  oversight of the user and it is believed that it is better not to start the simulation with an incorrect model.
  In fault-tolerant mode invalid technical free times are interpreted as "0".</li>
  <li>In the strict mode, the simulation is not started if in a <b>skill level</b> holding and post processing times
  are specified for a client type that does not exist. It is believed that this is a typo and it is therefore better not
††to start the simulation with an incorrect model. In fault-tolerant mode these unnecessary service times are simply ignored.</li>
  <li>If there are per call or per minute <b>costs</b> for a non existent client type specified at some agents group the
  simulation is not started if the strict mode is activated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
(As the default the strict model checking is activated.)
</p>

<h3>Use background simulation</h3>
<p>
If this option is active, the simulator will start the simulation with low priority
in the background while the model is still edited in the model editor. If the model
is changed in the editor, the current simulation will be discarded and a new
background simulation with the changed model will be started. When the user starts
the actual simulation, a part or the whole simulation then is already done and 
the results are available much faster.
</p>
<p>
If the background simulation is activated, the simulator will also usw computing time
when no simulation was started explicitly. If the client-server simulation is active,
neither local nor remote background simulations are performed regardless of this setting.
</p>
<p>
(As the default the background simulation is activated.)
</p>

<h3>Maximum number of threads</h3>
<p>
In the default case the simulator will use as many calculation threads as there are logical CPU cores
(in corresponds to entering 0 in the input box). But you can also define some additional, artificial
limitation to the number of used calculation threads by entering a value larger than 0. If you enter
a limitation value larger than the available number of logical CPU cores, still only as many threads
as there are CPU cores will be used.
</p>
<p>
(As the default 0 is specified, this means no artificial limitation of the number of used threads.)
</p>

<h3>Increase number of simulated days if useful</h3>
<p>
If this option is active, the number of simulated days may be increased to optimally use the
number of available CPU cores. This way the accuracy of the simulation may be slightly increased
without any increasement of the needed simulation time. The increasement will only be applied
on local simulation. On running a network simulation or a mixed local and network simulation
the number of simulated days will never be changed regardless of this setting.
</p>
<p>
(As the default value the increasing of the number of simulated days is active.)
</p>

<h3>Client-Server-Simulation</h3>
<p>
The two check boxes <b>Simulation on the local</b> and <b>Simulation on a computer in the network</b>
allow to set whether the simulation is to be performed directly within the graphic user interface of
the Callcenter Simulator or the simulation is to be performed on a remote (faster) computer in the network
and the results are then reported back to the local machine.
</p>
<p>
If the "Simulation on a computer in the network" option is enabled, the name of hte remote computer on which 
the simulation is to be performed and the port number of the simulation server has to be specified here. If the
remote server requires a password, the same password has to be entered here. Also multiple network servers can
be specified. The names, port numbers and passwords has to be entered separated by semikolons in the fields.
</p>
<p>
On the remote computer the Callcenter Simulator has to be started with the
<a href="Parameter.html">Command line parameter</a> <tt>server</tt> or in the menu
the item <a href="ToolsServer.html">Run network server</a> has to be choosen
so the simulator can receive simulation jobs via the network.
Furthermore on the server the same port and the same password as on the client machine has
to be specified.
</p>
<p>
In addition by the <b>Part of days to be simulated on the server</b> input line
the workload distribution between the local computer and the network server/s can configured.
This way both the server and the local computer can be utilized for the simulation at the same time.
</p>
<p>
(As the default value the local simulation is selected.)
</p>

<h2>Simulation server <img src="../images/server.png"></h2>

<p>
On this dialog page one can configure on which <b>Port</b> the simulation server and on which the web server
(in the case of running a SaaS server) should listen for incoming request,
if only requests encrypted with a specific <b>Password</b> are to be accepted and whether only requests from some
<b>Allowed client IPs</b> are to be accepted.
</p>

<h3>Allowed client IPs</h3>
<p>
If there are no addresses specified in this field, all clients are accepted,
otherwise only the clients whose IP addresses start with one of the combinations specified in this field are accepted.
Per line one IP address or a part of an IP address can be specified per line.
Symbols such as "*" can not be used, but anyway it is not necessary to enter a complete IP address.
If an incomplete IP address is specified, a client is accepted if its IP address starts with the here entered
letters combination.
</p>

<h2>Graphics <img src="../images/image.gif"></h2>
<p>
On this dialog page can be defined, which resolutions will be used when saving diagrams as pixel graphics.
The value in the input field <b>Resolution when saving images</b> will be used as the width and height in pixels.
<br>(The default value is 1000 pixels.)
</p>

<h2>Statistics <img src="../images/sum2.png"></h2>

<h3>Open texts and tables</h3>
<p>
By the selection fields on this page you can set up which external programs should
be offered for transferring the data from the statistics text and table pages.
<br>(As default Word and Excel are selected.)
</p>

<h2>Updates <img src="../images/tick.png"></h2>
<p>
On this page you can specify whether the call center simulator should automatically
check for new versions and to install them. When activated the automatic update is done
completely in the background. No manual installation of updates is required.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively you can manually download updates from the
<a href="special:programhome">webpage of the Callcenter Simulator</a>.
