  <title>Dialog "Edit agents group"</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Dialog "Edit agents group"</h1>

<p>
The dialog for editing the agents groups can be opened via the dialog page "Agents"
of the <a href="DialogCallcenter.html">Edit call center</a> dialog.
In the dialog "Edit agents group" you can set up the individual agents groups
of a call center.
</p>

<h2>Agents group active</h2>
<p>
This checkbox allows to set up whether this agents group should be taken into account in the simulation.
By the enabling or disabling agents groups quickly different scenarios can be tested
without the need to create different models.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/clock.png">&nbsp; "Working times"</h2>
<p>
During the simulation, the simulator always uses concrete agents with given working hours.
Because the working hours of individual agents are often not known and therefore are not available
as input data, the simulator can also use an agents distribuion. The Callcenter Simulator
will generate concrete agents then at the start of the simulation process.
(Also see the options for shift planning on the dialog page 
<a href="EditorAllgemeineDaten.html">General data</a> of the call center model editor.)
The option "Distribution over the day calculated from client arrivals" even more allows
to calculate the distribution of the agents over the day directly from the fresh calls
distribution. In this case even no explicit distribution of the agents has to be known.
</p>

<h3>Agents with fixed working times</h3>
<p>
If the option "Agents with fixed working times" is selected, you can specify directly of how many
agents the agents group should consist and on which interval the agents should be available for work.
Additionally you can select by activating the checkbox <b>Ignore end of working time and continue to work</b>
the agents to work until the end of the simulated day instead of respecting the working time end.
</p>

<h3>Predetermined distribution over the day</h3>
<p>
If "Predetermined distribution over the day" is selected you can set up how many agents in the
selected group should be available by interval. Before the actual simulation is started
agents with fixed working hours are generated from these data. In order to get as close as possible
to the real behavior of a call center agents are not generated with half-hour working times but
the simulator is trying to produce shifts of the length specified on the dialog page
<a href="EditorAllgemeineDaten.html">General data</a> of the call center simulator.
If you click on <b>Show shift plan</b> the simulator will show you a shift schedule
generated from the data immediately.
</p>

<p>
In addition, you can set up whether the agents who regularly work until 24 clock will continue to work
until no more customers are in the system. If only a single day simulated, this option should
be activated in order to avoid that in the last interval dropouts occur, which in real the
system (in which the next day starts) do not occur. If a connected system is simulated over several days,
this option can be disabled, because in this case callers are transfered to the next day in this case.
</p>

<h3>Distribution over the day calculated from client arrivals</h3>
<p>
If the option "Distribution over the day calculated from client arrivals" is activated
the available agents working hours, which can be specified by the input line
<b>Available agents half-hours</b> will be distributed over the day by the fresh calls
by the selected client types. The rate at which the different client types are taken
into account can be specifed in the <b>Rate</b> input filed. The bigger the rate for
a client type is, the stronger it is used when calculating the agents distribution.
In order to get as close as possible to the real behavior of a call center agents are not
generated with half-hour working times but the simulator is trying to produce shifts of the
length specified on the dialog page  <a href="EditorAllgemeineDaten.html">General data</a>
of the call center simulator. If you click on <b>Show shift plan</b> the simulator will
show you a shift schedule generated from the data on half-hourly basis immediately.
</p>

<p>
In the mode "Distribution over the day calculated from client arrivals" the the number of
needed agents to serve a specified part of the fresh calls can be calculated by the
<b>Set up number from calculated load</b> function from the <b>Tools</b> menu. Because this
calucation is done using static information (average holding and post processing times and
fresh calls) and does not respect fluctuation in the incoming calls and the holding times,
this will be only an estimation of the needed number of agents.
</p>

<h3>Productivity</h3>
<p>
In this dialog you can set how much of the specified agent working time
will be actually available. The data refer to the current agent group
and will only be available if the group is not defined by fixed working hours.
It can be stated that the agents are always available as indicated,
that they are only available for a certain fixed proportion of the specified time
or that the productivity varies in half-hourly intervals.
In addition, you can set up to use the global values.
</p>

<h3>Disease-related surcharge</h3>
<p>
In this dialog you can set up how much agents percentage specified in the
agents distributions should be added to compensate sick leave.
The resulting increased agents distribution is not used in the simulation,
but displayed in the statistics. The data refer to the current agent group
and will only be available if the group is not defined by fixed working hours.
It can be stated that no surcharge should be used, a percentage surcharge
identical for all intervals or an individual surcharge for each half-hour interval.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/rosette.png">&nbsp; "Skill level"</h2>
<p>
For each agents group a skill level has to be chosen, that defines which
client types can be served by the agents from this group.
</p>

<p>
By the button <b>Edit skill level</b> you can directly open the
<a href="DialogSkillLevel.html">dialog for editing the selected skill level</a>,
so the chosen skill level of the agents group can be changed at once.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/money_euro.png">&nbsp; "Costs"</h2>
<p>
Each agents group can be assigned to an hourly wage and costs
per served call and per holding and post processing minute.
The cost per servered call and per holding and post processing minute
can be specifed per client type additionally.
