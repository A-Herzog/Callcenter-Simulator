</div>

<h1>Dialog page "Caller groups" of the model editor</h1>

<p>
On the dialog page "Caller groups" of the call center model editor the
individual caller groups for the call centers can be defined.
</p>

<p>
Each client group can have custom properties such as the number and distribution
of calls per day, waiting time tolerance of the clients etc.
</p>

<p>
By the <b>Add</b> button new caller groups can be created
and by the <b> Edit</b> button existing groups can be configured
in the <a href="DialogCaller.html">Edit client type</a> dialog.
</p>

<p>
The sorting of the groups, which can be changed by the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b>
buttons, has no meaning for the simulation itself and is only offered to make
the list more clear for the user.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Copy</b> function allows copy duplicate some agents groups.
On copying a caller group the program will ask for a name for the
new caller group. Additionally one can set up the size of the new
group compared to the existing caller groups. All other properties
are copied directly.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Tools</b> popup menu offers to open the
<a href="ToolsGeneratorKunden.html">"Load client data" dialog</a>
directy. From this dialog the call distribution for all client types
can be loaded from a table at once.
