<h1>Fit distribution</h1>

<p>
This function allows to determine which probability distirbution
available in the call center simulator fits best a given set of data.
</p>

<p>
To use this feature, a series of samples has to be loaded from the clipboard or a file.
The distribution fitter can process directly recorded sample values (one row or column) or
cummulated sample values (two row or columns; the values in the first and their frequencys in the second).
An empirical distribution is created from this data and based on this distribution by
using the mean squre distance the analytical probability distributions available in the call center simulator
which fits best is determined.
