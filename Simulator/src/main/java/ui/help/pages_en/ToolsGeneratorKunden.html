<h1>Dialog "Load client data"</h1>

<p>
The "Load client data" dialog allows to load the fresh calls distribution all client types in a call center from a table.
</p>

<p>
At first in the field <b>Table file</b> the name of a file from which the data is to be loaded
has to be specified. The combo boxes below <b>Client type</b>
allows to select which table row to use for which client type.
The simulator already tries to do a sensible default reference to the column headings in the table file.
</p>

<h2>Structure of the table file</h2>

<p>
To load the fresh calls distribution of all client types of a call center from a spreadsheet file,
it has to have a certain structure. The fresh calls distribution for a client type consists of
48 numbers that indicate how many clients will arrive in each half-hour interval.
These 48 numbers has to be in the table in 48 contiguous rows of a column.
In each column, the data of an individual client type can be stored.
If multiple client types should be loaded at once, the table has to contain multiple data columns.
The columns do not need to be next to each other but all column data areas have to start in the same line.
All non-empty rows above the first row containing a numbers are interpreted as column headers.
The column headers are displayed below the caption <b>Table column</b>. If there is no non-number
value cell above the 48 numerical cells, the column is names like the column letter
(e.g. "Column A", "Column B" etc.).
