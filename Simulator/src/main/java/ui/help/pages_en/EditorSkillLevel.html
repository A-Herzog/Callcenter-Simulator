<h1>Dialog page "Skill levels of the agents" of the model editor</h1>

<p>
On the dialog page "Skill levels of the agents" of the call center model editor the skill levels
of the agents in the call centers can be defined. Agents of each skill level can serve a certain
subset of the client types. Each skill level defines the holding and post-processing time distributions
for the agents of this type for the different client types.
</p> 

<p>
If an agent group is added in a call center, it has to get assigned one of the here defined 
skill levels.
</p>

<p>
By the <b>Add</b> button a new skill levels can be created
and by the <b> Edit</b> button existing skill levels can be configured
in the <a href="DialogSkillLevel.html">Edit skill level</a> dialog.
</p>

<p>
The sorting of the skill levels, which can be changed by the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b>
buttons, has no meaning for the simulation itself and is only offered to make
the list more clear for the user.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Copy</b> function allows copy duplicate some skill levels.
On copying a skill level the program will ask for a name for the
new skill level. All other properties are copied directly.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Tools</b> popup menu offers to open the
<a href="ToolsGeneratorSkill.html">"Load skill data" dialog</a>
directy. From this dialog the holding and post processing times
for the agents of different skill levels  can be loaded from a table at once.
