</div>

<h1>Dialog page "Call center and agents" of the model editor</h1>

<p>
On the dialog page "Call center and agents" of the call center model editor
the individual call centers where the calls will be processed can be defined.
</p>

<p>
Each call center can have an individual set of properties (like score values and minimum waiting times)
and in particular can have an individual set of agents.
</p>

<p>
By the <b>Add</b> button a new call center can be created
and by the <b> Edit</b> button existing call centers can be configured
in the <a href="DialogCallcenter.html">Edit call center</a> dialog.
</p>

<p>
The sorting of the call centers, which can be changed by the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b>
buttons, has no meaning for the simulation itself and is only offered to make
the list more clear for the user.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Copy</b> function allows copy duplicate some call centers.
On copying a call center the program will ask for a name for the
new call center. Additionally one can set up if the number of agents
should be scaled by some value on copying. All other properties
are copied directly.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Tools</b> popup menu offers to open the
<a href="ToolsGeneratorAgenten.html">"Load agents data" dialog</a>
directy. From this dialog the agents working hours of all agents
from one call center can be loaded from a table at once.
