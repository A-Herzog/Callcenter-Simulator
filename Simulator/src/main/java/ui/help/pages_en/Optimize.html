Simulation &gt; Optimizer
</div>

<h1>Optimizer</h1>

<p>
Using the optimizer allows to determine how many agents are necessary to achieve specific service parameters.
It can be both set which parameter is to be achieved through which clients group, and which agents group is
to be changed in order to approach the target.
</p>

<p>
As starting model, the current call center model is used. The model is changed in each optimization simulation run,
until the desired values are achieved. The original model in the editor will remain unchanged, the new model
will be offered to save after the optimization.
</p>

<p>
When the optimization is done, the results will be displayed in the 
<a href="OptimizeViewer.html">optimization results viewer</a>.
As results the change of the key parameters over the optimization
process as well as the statistic results of the individual simulation runs
are stored.
</p>

<p>
Before you can start the optimization process by clicking the <b>Start optimization</b>
button you have to configurate what to optimize:
</p>

<h2>Optimization property <img src="../images/chart_bar_add.png"></h2>

<h3>Property to be optimized and its destination value</h3>
<p>
In this box and the following input line you can specify, which property is to be optimized and which value is to be achieved.
For optimization properties of the clients (accessibility, average waiting waiting time,average residence time and service level)
as well as properties of the agents (work load) can be selected.  In addition a second value can be selected on which the number
of agents is reduced if it is exceeded (service level, accessibility) or underflowed (waiting time, residence time, work load).
If this option is not explicitly activated, the number of agents is only raised during the optimization.
</p>

<h3>Target value is to be achieved over... (time span)</h3>
<p>
This combobox allows you to set whether the target has to be achieved in average throughout the day or in each half-hour interval.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you do an optimization in average over the whole day, it is possible that the target is not reached in any individual interval,
  but this is compensated by particularly good values in some intervals with many customers and many agents.</li>
  <li>If the option <b>In each interval</b> is selected, the target must be achieved in each interval.
  If the target is particularly over reached in an interval, this is not counted for other intervals in which the
  optimization goal is not yes reached.</li>  
  <li>
  If the option <b>In each interval (optimization in order)</b> is selected, target must not only be achieved in each interval,
  but the optimizer also works during the optimization process interval by interval. This means that if the target is not reached
  in an interval the simulator will not change the next interval before the first one is not done. This approach often leads to
  lower numbers of agents in the same intervals as the "in each interval" option.<br><br>
  If the target is exceeded in two successive intervals and therefore the number of agents increases in both intervals,
  the service parameters will improve in both intervals. This results in less canceling callers in the first interval,
  many of which would have occurred again in the second interval as a retryer. This means the workload decreases in the second
  interval and possibly it would not have been necessary to increase the number of agents in this interval.
  Exactly this effect is addressed by the interval by interval optimization.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Target value is to be achieved over... (Clients or agents group)</h3>
<p>
In this field you can select which clients or agents groups should reach the target value.
If you are going to optimize over all groups, you can additionally set up if the target
needs to be achieved in average over all groups or of each group individually.
</p>

<h2>Control variable <img src="../images/wrench.png"></h2>

<h3>Change number of agents in each run by this percentage value</h3>
<p>
In this field you can specify by which amount the number of agents
is change in the affected intervals when the target was not achieved
in a simulation run.
</p>

<p>
If the change in the number of agents rounded to the nearest integer number
did not change the number, the same percentage value is added again added to
the number of agents before the next simulation run is started.
</p>

<p>
The base value that equal to 100% is always the initial number of agents.
This means 1% always means the same absolute number of agents.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
In this dialog you can set up minimal and maximal values per agents group and per half-hour interval
which have to be respected. The simulator will try to reach the specified optimization targets while
meeting these additional restrictions.
</p>

<h3>Change number of agents in these agents groups</h3>
<p>
In this field one can determine which agent groups should be increased in order
to achieve the target. Either all or only some groups can be changed per simulation run.
</p>

<h2>Intervals <img src="../images/time.png"></h2>

<p>
On this page you can set up on which intervals the optimization is to be
performed (in respect to the performance indicators and to the number of agents per interval).
As default value all intervals are respected, this the optimization is done
over the whole day.
</p>

<h2>Carry over <img src="../images/calendar.png"></h2>

<p>
This page allows to define some carry over from a previous day, which is to be fed
into the simulation model. By specifying a statistics file from a previous simulation run,
a direct transfer of waiting and cancel clients is possible. There is also the option to
manually define an initial number of clients who is present at the beginning of the simulation.
An exact transfer of individual customers incl. their residual waiting time tolerance etc.
is only possible when using a statistics file.
