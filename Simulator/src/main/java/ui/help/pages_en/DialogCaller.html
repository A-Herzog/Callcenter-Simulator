  <title>Dialog "Edit client type"</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Dialog "Edit client type"</h1>

<p>
The dialog for editing the client type can be opened by the dialog page
<a href="EditorAnrufergruppen.html">Caller groups</a> from the call center
model editor. In the dialog "Edit client type" you can set up the individual
client types in the model.
</p>

<h3>Client type active</h3>
<p>
This checkbox allows to set up whether this client group should be taken into account in the simulation.
By the enabling or disabling client groups quickly different scenarios can be tested
without the need to create different models.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/wrench.png">&nbsp; "Count and distribution"</h2>
<p>
On this dialog page you can specify how many clients should start a fresh call per half-hour interval.
The information "calls per interval" is divided into two parts: By the <b>Number of fresh calls</b> and
the  <b>Standard deviation</b> the total number of fresh calls and their scattering from day to day
of the considered type of clients groups is defined. On the other hand the distribution of the fresh
calls over the day is defined by the <b>distribution diagramm</b>. This way the total number of calls
can be varied without having to adjust all 48 half-hour intervals individually.
</p>

<h3>Distribution diagramm</h3>
<p>
The distribution diagramm indicates the spread of the fresh calls throughout the day.
The values for the intervals do not give absolute values of fresh calls, but the relative
distributed over the day. You can set whether to split the day in 24, 48 or 96 intervals,
so the distribution of the fresh calls can be defined on an hourly, half-hour or 15-minute basis.
</p>

<h3>"Tools" button</h3>
<p>
As values in the distribution diagramm can be chosen so that the values add up to 1
or that the values are the add up to the actual number of fresh calls (and thus the values for
each half-hour interval will represent the the number of fresh calls per half-hour interval).
The pop-up menu that appears when you click the Tools button, provides, inter alia, these options.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/clock.png">&nbsp; "Waiting time tolerance"</h2>

<h3>Clients are only willing to wait for a finite time</h3> 
<p>
If this option is enabled, enter the waiting clients will cancel the waiting after a certain time
and possibly will make a new attempt later. The way the waiting time tolerance of the clients is
determined in detail, can be configured in the following fields.
</p>

<h3>Options: "Waiting time tolerance distribution specified", "Waiting time tolerance distribution specified (long waiting time tolerance)" and "Waiting time tolerance estimated from measured values"</h3>
<p>
To determine an individual, random waiting time tolerance for each caller, a waiting time tolerance
distribution has to be specified. If the real world waiting time tolerance of the clients of the
selected type is known (approximately) the waiting time tolerance can be specified directly
(options "waiting time tolerance distribution specified" and "waiting time tolerance distribution specified (long waiting time tolerance)").
Otherwise the simulator can try to estimate the waiting time tolerance by using an
Erlang C model and the measured mean waiting time and the measured cancel rate
(option "Waiting time tolerance estimated from measured values").
Because for the second approach some assumptions has to be be made, which may not apply to the real model,
the estimation is not necessarily exact. However since the actual waiting time tolerance is usually not known,
in many cases this this the only useable method.
</p>

<h3>Waiting time tolerance distribution</h3>
<p>
If in the above combo box "Waiting time tolerance distribution specified" is selected, the exact waiting time
tolerance distribution can be specified. It should be noted here that the waiting time tolerance distribution
is <b>not</b> the canceling time distribution of the canceled calls! The clients woh cancel waiting in the
real world usually will have an quite short waiting time tolerance so using the cancel time distribution
of the clients as an estimation for the waiting time tolerance distribution of all clients this would
significantly underestimate the real waiting time tolerances and would lead to incorrect simulation results.
</p>

<h3>Waiting time tolerance estimation</h3>
<p>
If in the above combo box "Waiting time tolerance estimated from measured values" is selected, the actual waiting
time tolerance of the clients of this type can be estimated by the values of the next three input lines. The
estimation function assumes that the waiting time tolerances is exponentially distributed (which is usually not applicable),
so that the average waiting time of the clients can be calculated from the <b>Average waiting time</b>
and the <b>Cancel rate</b>. The average waiting time tolerance estimated that way (which will also be the
standard deviation of the exponential distribution) will be used was used as the expected value of a
log-normal distribution. Due to the usually not accurate assumtion of the exponential distribution the
estimated and the true (not directly measurable) waiting time tolerance of the clients will usually
will differ significantly. Since the waiting time tolerance usually can not be determined directly,
this estimation often is the only possible way to get to input data for the simulation.
</p>

<p>
The concept of <b>calibartion</b> can be used to reduce the estimation error: As input data the measured values
of an actual day, wherein in particular availability, mean waiting time, etc., are used. From these data
a simulation model is created in which the waiting time tolerance is appreciated. After the simulation
measured accessibility and accessibility in the simulation are compared and the waiting time tolerance
estimate is adjusted if necessary using the <b>correction value</b>.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/arrow_redo.png">&nbsp; "Retry probability"</h2>

<h3>Clients of this type require a telephone line (if not, blocking cannot happen for this client type)</h3>
<p>
Specifies whether clients this type will be counted against the number of available phone lines.
For clients calling by phone, this is true; for clients who e.g. write an e-mail not.
</p>

<h3>Retry probability</h3>
<p>
By using the four input fields on this dialog page one can specify the
retry probability of the clients in dependence of the reason of
canceling the current call.
</p>

<p>
With sales call centers usually low values are realistic. (The customer buys at a fellow competitor.)
For technical hotlines and emergency services usually have very high values (near 100%) are common,
as the clients will not give up finally with a very high probability, as long as their problems are not solved.
</p>

<h3>Client type change on retry</h3>
<p>
Usually clients will retain their type on a new call attempt. But by the buttons on the
right side of the retry probability input lines can be set up that a client will change
its type in a repeated call attempt. The rate at which a change to which client type occurs
can be set in the dialog which can be opened via the four buttons.
</p> 

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/arrow_redo.png">&nbsp; "Retry intervals"</h2>
<p>
According to the retry intervals distribution which can be defined on this
dialog page for each caller who chanceled waiting and will start a new
attempt later the interval before the new call is calculated.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/arrow_right.png">&nbsp; "Forwarding"</h2>
<p>
In some cases the question of a caller is not fully aswered by a single agent
(e.g. when the agent has only information on contracts, but the caller has questions
about contracts and technical specifications of a product). In this case, the call
will be for forwarded to another agent with other skills. 
Usually there will be a client type in the simulation for each real client type
calling the call center. (This real client type is frequently determined by some
computer voice system which the calls will pass before entering the queue.)
When forwarding in this case just the client type has to be changed
(for example from "clients with commercial questions" to "clients with technical questions")
so agents with other skill levels will be responsible for this client.
</p>

<h3>Probability fo forwarding a client after a conversation</h3>
<p>
The input field probability for forwarding allows to enter the
probability that a client of the current type is forwarded to
another agent after the conversation.
</p>

<h3>Forwarding rates to the different client types</h3>
<p>
In the input fields below this heading one can enter the rates at which the type of
the client will change to another client type on forwarding. The values are rates
(i.e. a kind of unnormalized probabilities); this means they do not need to sum up
to 1, they just have to give the ratio of the values to each other. 
If a client of type A is forwarded in 1/3 of all cases to type B and in 2/3 of all
cases to type B, the values could be entered as 1 and 2, but just as 0.333 and 0.666.
</p>

<h3>Agent type dependent forwarding</h3>
<p>
Often it depends not only on the type of the client, whether he is forwarded after
a conversation or not, but also on the skill level of the agent who served him. If
a client who has questions about several topics, operated by a single-skill agent,
he will almost certainly forwarded after the call. If the same client but operated
by a multi-skill agents, the forwarding probability is likely to be much lower.
</p>
<p>
In the dialog <b>Agent type dependent forwarding</b> such individual forwarding rules
depending on the skill level of the agent who served the client can be defined. If there
is no special rule defined for a skill level, the normal forwarding rules will be used.
Only if for a skill level the checkbox <b>Activate rules for this skill level</b> is
selected, the specific rules defined here will be applied.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/arrow_divide.png">&nbsp; "Recall probability"</h2>
<p>
It may happen that a client after being successfully served (which mey
contain being forwarded) starts a second call later anyway. On this
dialog page one can specify the probability at which this recalling
happens for clients of the selected type and how (with which rates)
the type of the client will change on a recall.
</p>

<h3>Probability for recalling after successfully being served</h3>
<p>
In the input field probability for a recall you can specify the probability 
that a client of that selected type if starting a second call
after successful completation of a first call.
</p>

<h3>Chlient type change on recalling</h3>
<p>
In the input fields below this heading one can enter the rates at which the type of
the client will change to another client type on recalling. The values are rates
(i.e. a kind of unnormalized probabilities); this means they do not need to sum up
to 1, they just have to give the ratio of the values to each other. 
If a client of type A is changing its type on recalling in 1/3 of all cases to type B
and in 2/3 of all cases to type B, the values could be entered as 1 and 2,
but just as 0.333 and 0.666.
</p>

<h3>Agent type depending recalls</h3>
<p>
Often it depends not only on the type of the client, whether he is starting second call
after finishing the first call or not, but also on the skill level of the agent who served him.
</p>

<p>
In the dialog <b>Skill level dependent recalling</b> such individual recalling rules
depending on the skill level of the agent who served the client can be defined. If there
is no special rule defined for a skill level, the normal recalling rules will be used.
Only if for a skill level the checkbox <b>Activate rules for this skill level</b> is
selected, the specific rules defined here will be applied.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/arrow_divide.png">&nbsp; "Recall intervals"</h2>
<p>
Based on the distribution defined on this dialog page for each client starting
a second all after being served on the frist call an interval at which this
second call is start is calculated.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/calculator.png">&nbsp; "Score"</h2>
<p>
To determine which waiting client is to be assigned to the next free
agent a client score is calculated. The client score is the sum of two or three values:
The base score, the score per waiting second and possibly an additional score value for redirects.
</p>

<h3>Base score for this client type</h3>
<p>
Each caller of the considered type of clients gets a base score
right when he enters the queue. The higher the value, the higher the
initial score of the caller and the faster it gets to an agent.
</p>

<h3>Additional score per waiting second</h3>
<p>
In order to produce a certain amount of waiting justice, the score value
of a client can be increased per waiting second. In this input field you
can specify how by many points the score value is to be increased per waiting second.
That this field Gewichtun base score can be set to wait. This means this field
allows to define the weighting of the waiting time and base score.
</p>

<h3>Additional score when forwarding the caller</h3>
<p>
Because clients that get forwarded already have passed through the queue once,
it is often desirable that they are preferred by getting a higher score value and
thus earlier come to an agent without again to go through a full waiting period.
A high value in this box can achieve this behavior.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/money_euro.png">&nbsp; "Costs"</h2>

<p>
On this dialog page you can specify, which (possibly non-material)
costs per waiting canceling and per waiting per second of a client of this type are to be recorded
and which (in turn may be ideal) earnings per successful served client of this type should be recorded.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/clock.png">&nbsp; "Service level"</h2>

<p>
On this dialog page you can specify whether the global service level value or some
client type specific value is to be used when recording the statistics during the simulation.
