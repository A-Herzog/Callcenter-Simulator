<h1>Event-driven simulation</h1>

<p>
In an event-driven stochastic simulator customer arrivals are generated randomly in accordance
to a predefined distribution. These virtual customers are served by virtual agents, which are
defined by their needed holding time distributions etc. This means a corresponding simulator
is essentially a simplified version of the reality.
</p>

<h2>Possibilities when using event-driven stochastic simulation</h2>
<p>
In principle in a simulation model the impact of all changes to the system
which can be done to the real system can be examined. Thus one can examine
in a simple (and low-cost) way the impact of changes to the number of agents
or other allocation strategies of customers to agents.
</p>

<h2>Limitations when using event-driven stochastic simulation</h2>
<ul class="big">
<li><b>Accuracy of the input data</b><br>
In general, the results of a simulation can be at most as good as
the input data. If the holding times, the arrival rates, the waiting
time tolerances, etc. not precisely known, no exact results can be
expected from the simulation. - However, this is often not necessary.
The main task of simulation is not to predict the reality at 100%, but
to offer qualitatively assess of the impact of changes to the system.
Thus, the simulator may not meets the actual accessibility, which occurs
after the change of customer prioritization, perfectly, but it provides
a very reliable statement as to whether the new strategy is better or
worse than the previous.
</li>
<li><b>Output of statistical averages</b><br>
During the simulation a number of different days generated on basis of the
given source data probability distributions are processed. The result,
which is ouputed at the end of the simulation, is the average over all
these specific days. Therefore, it is not to be expected that the simulator
exactly returns the measured results that occurred on a particular day,
even if the exact distributions of customer arrivals, the service times
etc. are used! Very probably, however, the simulator provides values that
will arise as average values over many days. Therefore it would be a
mistake to assume that the simulation results generally would not apply,
because the measured results for a particular day are not met exactly.
If a dice simulator reports that the average value is 3.5, this also does
not mean that the next roll of the dice will be a 3.5!
