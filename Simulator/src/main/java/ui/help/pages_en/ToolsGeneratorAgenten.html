<h1>Dialog "Load agents data"</h1>

<p>
The "Load agents data" dialog allows to load the available agent performance for all groups of agents
in a call center from a table.
</p>

<p>
At first in the field <b>Table file</b> the name of a file from which the data is to be loaded
has to be specified. After that you can select in the <b>Call center</b> box the call center
for which the agent data will be used. The combo boxes below <b>Agent group</b>
allows to select which table row to use for which agents group.
The simulator already tries to do a sensible default reference to the column headings in the table file.
</p>

<h2>Structure of the table file</h2>

<p>
To load the agents working time distributions of all agents groups of a call center from a spreadsheet file,
it has to have a certain structure. The agents working time distribution for an agent group consists of
48 numbers that indicate how many agents are active in each half-hour interval.
These 48 numbers has to be in the table in 48 contiguous rows of a column.
In each column, the data of an individual group of agents can be stored.
If multiple groups of agents should be loaded at once, the table has to contain multiple data columns.
The columns do not need to be next to each other but all column data areas have to start in the same line.
All non-empty rows above the first row containing a numbers are interpreted as column headers.
The column headers are displayed below the caption <b>Table column</b>. If there is no non-number
value cell above the 48 numerical cells, the column is names like the column letter
(e.g. "Column A", "Column B" etc.). If there are client type names (one per line) above the agents data, the simulator
trys to find a matching skill type and selects this in the <b> Agents group</b> field.
