<h1>Connected simulation with carrying over canceled calls</h1>

<p>
In the connected simulation several days with individual characteristics
are simulated successively and the clients canceling one day are partially
carried over to the next day. In this way the movement of an overload wave
from one day to the next day can be reproduced in the simulation.
</p>

<p>
This function is also available via the <a href="Parameter.html">command line parameters</a>.
</p>

<h2>Base folder</h2>
<p>
Here you can specify any directory. If the model and statistic files listed below
are stored in the directory the file names are displayed without the full path name.
</p>

<h2>Statistic for carry over into day 1 (optional)</h2>
<p>
On the connected simulation client request that are waiting over 0 clock
(i.e. waiting mails) are automatically carried over to the next day
(including their previous waiting time).
In order to be able to take client data into the first day of the simulation,
in this field a statistic file can be specified containing data from the
day before the first simulation day.
</p>

<h2>Additional manual carry over into day 1</h2>
<p>
Additionally or alternatively to carrying over clients into day 1 by using
a statistic file containing data from the day before the first simulation day
here you can define some manual carry over into the first simulation day.
