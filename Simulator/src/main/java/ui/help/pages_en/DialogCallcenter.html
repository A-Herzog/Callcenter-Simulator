  <title>Dialog "Edit call center"</title>

<body>

<h1>Dialog "Edit call center"</h1>

<p>
The dialog for editing the call centers can be opened by the dialog page
<a href="EditorCallcenter.html">Call center and  agents</a> from the call center
model editor. In the dialog "Edit call center" you can set up the individual
call centers in the model.
</p>

<h3>Call center active</h3>
<p>
This checkbox allows to set up whether this call center should be taken into account in the simulation.
By the enabling or disabling call centers quickly different scenarios can be tested
without the need to create different models.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/group.png">&nbsp; "Agents"</h2>
<p>
On the dialog page "Agents" of call center edit dialog you can define the individual agent groups
who will work in the selected call center. Each agent group can have individual work schedules and skill levels.
</p>

<p>
By clicking the <b>Add</b> button you can add new agents groups
to the call center and by clicking the <b>Edit</b> button you
can change the settings of existing agents groups in the
<a href="DialogAgenten.html">Edit agents group</a> dialog.
</p>

<p>
The order of agent groups can be changed by the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons.
The ordering of the agents groups has no influence on the simulation and and is
only offered to make the list for the user more clearly.
</p>

<p>
The <b> Copy</b> function allows to copy the seleczed agents group.
While copying the number of agents in the group can optionally
be scaled. All other properties are copied directly.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Tools</b> popup menu allows to open the
<a href="ToolsGeneratorAgenten.html">"Load agents data" dialog</a>
directly. In this dialog, the agent working hours, the productivity etc.
for all agents groups of the call center can be loaded at once from a table.
</p>

<p>
Additionally one can load multiple agents groups at once from a three
columned table with number of agents, shift start and shift end in each
line.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/wrench.png">&nbsp; "Call center parameters"</h2>
<p>
On the dialog page "Call center parameters" you can edit the global properties
of the call center which apply to all agents groups in the call center.
</p>

<h3>Technical free time</h3>
<p>
Between the association of a waiting client to a free agents by the
Automated Call Distributor (ACD) and the start of the actual conversation
a few seconds will pass. Since the caller does not realize that he is
already assigned to an agent, he feels this time as waiting time and
still can cancel his while during this time.
</p>

<h3>The technical free time is perceived as waiting time, i.e. the client can still cancel waiting during this time.</h3>
<p>
If this option is enabled (which is the default), then the client can not realize
if he is already assigned to an agent and is now in the technical free time.
He feels this time then as waiting time and so can also cancel the waiting just
before the conversation starts. If the option is disabled, the customer realizes
that he is already assigned to an agent and the conversation will start in a few seconds.
He will not cancel the waiting anymore at this time. Regardless of the chosen
type of the technical free time this time is reported in the statistics on the
clients page as waiting time and is reported as a individual time segment in
the agents work load statistic.
</p> 

<h3>Call center scroe</h3>
<p>
For each free agent a score value is calculated. If there are several
free agents appropriate for a waiting caller, the caller is redirected
to the agent with the highest score value. The agents score consists of
the set global call center base score, a skill level dependent score value
and an additive factor respecting the idle time and the idle portion of the agent.
</p>

<h3>Factor to respect the free time since last call fo the agent score</h3>
<p>
In this field you can specifiy, at which value each second of being idle since
the last call should be respected when calculating the agent core.
</p>

<h3>Factor to respect the idel time part of the agent score</h3>
<p>
In this field you can specifiy, at which value the idle portion of
the agent should be respected when calculating the agent core.
</p>

<h3>Attention</h3>
<p>
To ensure to balance the work load between the agents in at least
one of the two fields above a value greater than 0 should be entered.
</p>

<h3>Agents group productivity in this call center</h3>
<p>
In this dialog you can set up how much of the specified agent working time will
actually be available. The data refer to all agents groups in this call center
that are not defined by fixed working hours. It can be stated that the agents
are always available as defined, that they are only available for a certain
fixed proportion of the specified time or that the productivity varies in
over the half-hour intervals. Additionally you can set the global values
to be used and that there are no special parameters for this call center.
The global settings you define here can optionally be overridden per agents group.
</p>

<h3>Disease-related surcharge in this call center</h3>
<p>
In this dialog one can set up how much agents should be added for planning
to the number of agents defined in the model to compensate disease-related
leave. The resulting increased number of agents is not used in the simulation,
but is also displayed in the statistics. The data refer to all agent groups
which are not defined by fixed working hours. It can be selected that no
surcharge should be planned, a fixed percentage of surchare or that the 
surcharge should vary from half-hour interval to half-hour interval.
Additionally you can set the global values to be used and that
there are no special parameters for this call center. The global settings
you define here can optionally be overridden per agents group.
</p>

<h2>Tab &nbsp;<img src="../images/clock.png">&nbsp; "Minimum waiting times"</h2>
<p>
The individual utilization of the different call centers can be influenced by assigning
different score values. If this gives not enough spread in the values, minimum waiting times
can be set for certain types of clients and certain call centers. A client will only be passed
to a free agent in this call center when its minimum waiting time is over and no suitable 
free agent has been found in another call center for him until then.
</p>

<p>
While assigning different score values only shifts the idle portion between
the call centers and thus does not affect the total available work power or
the accessibility, setting a minimum wait time degrades the performance parameters
of the queuing system. If a minimum time is used, a total of more agents has to be 
planned in order to reach the same values for accessibility, average waiting time, etc.
