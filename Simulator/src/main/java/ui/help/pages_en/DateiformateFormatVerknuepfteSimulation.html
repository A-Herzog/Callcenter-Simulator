<h2>File header</h2>

<tt>&lt;!DOCTYPE ConnectedSimulation SYSTEM "CallcenterSimulator_en.dtd"&gt;</tt>
</p>

<p>The root node for connected simulations is <tt>&lt;ConnectedSimulation&gt;</tt>. It has to habe an
<tt>BaseFolder</tt> attribute which defined the base folder for all other relative directory specifications.

Des Weiteren kann es ein Attribut <tt>InitialCarryOver</tt> besitzen, welches
den Namen einer Statistikdatei angibt, aus der der Übertrag zum ersten Tag hin entnommen werden soll.</p>

<p>
Each connected simulation node has to have one or more <tt>&lt;ConnectedDay&gt;</tt> nodes.
Each <tt>&lt;ConnectedDay&gt;</tt> node represents one simulation day. Additional a
<tt>&lt;VerknuepftInitialerBestand&gt;</tt> sub node can be added.
</p>

<h2>Information about the individual simulation days</h2>

<p>
Each <tt>&lt;ConnectedDay&gt;</tt> node has to have the following three sub nodes in this order:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>&lt;ConnectedModel&gt;</tt>:
  Specifies the model to be simulated (file name of the model xml file). If the node is empty, the model of the previous
  day is used. For the first day the node may not be empty. If the content of the node contains a directory name separator,
  the path is interpreted as an absolute path, otherwise it is processed relative to the specified base folder.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ConnectedStatistics&gt;</tt>:  
  Specifies the filename for the statistic output. If this node is empty, the statistic results of this day will not
  be saved and only used internal for connection with the next day. If the specificed statistics file already exists,
  it will be overwritten. If the content of the node contains a directory name separator,
  the path is interpreted as an absolute path, otherwise it is processed relative to the specified base folder.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOvers&gt;</tt>: This node can contain one or morde <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt> child nodes.
  Each <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt> node has to have the attributes <tt>Type</tt> and <tt>Value</tt>.
  The nodes specify how many of the clients who canceled waiting are to be added as fresh calls on the next day.
  If the <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOvers&gt;</tt> node is empty, no carrying over will be processed. If the  
  <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOvers&gt;</tt> node has exactly on <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt> child node,
  the <tt>Type</tt> attribute of this child node has to be empty. The <tt>Value</tt> attribute in this case
  specifes the part of canceled clients who will be added as fresh calls the next day global for all client types.
  If the <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOvers&gt;</tt> node has more than one <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt> child nodes,
  the carrying over will be done individual per client type. Each <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt> node specifies
  the data for one client type. The client type is defined by the <tt>Type</tt> attribute. <tt>Wert</tt> stores
  the part of the canceled clients who will be carried over. There is no need to create <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt>
  nodes for all client types. If a node is missing for a client type <tt>Value="0"</tt> will be assumed and canceled
  clients of this type will not be carried over. All client types specified by <tt>Type</tt> attributes have to
  exist in the simulation model. The <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt> node can optionally have sub nodes of
  the type <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOverNeuerKundentyp&gt;</tt>. Each <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOverNeuerKundentyp&gt;</tt>
  node has to have the attributes <tt>Type</tt> and <tt>Value</tt> which define at which rate the type of
  a client will be changes to which type on carrying over. If a <tt>&lt;ConnectedCarryOver&gt;</tt> node
  does not have any <tt>&lt;VerknuepftUebertragNeuerKundentyp&gt;</tt> sub nodes, so client type changing will
  be done.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information about manual carrying over into day 1</h2>

<p>
The optional <tt>&lt;ConnectedInitialInventory&gt;</tt> node can have any number of
<tt>&lt;ConnectedInitialInventoryClientType&gt;</tt> child nodes. Each
<tt>&lt;ConnectedInitialInventoryClientType&gt;</tt> node has to have a <tt>Name</tt> attribute
which defines the client type for which the information are to be used. As content the
<tt>&lt;ConnectedInitialInventoryClientType&gt;</tt> node has to contain a non-negative interger number
specifying how many additional fresh calls should be added as manuel carry over into the first day
of the connected simulation.
