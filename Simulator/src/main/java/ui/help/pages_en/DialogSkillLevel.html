<h1>Dialog "Edit skill level"</h1>

<p>
The dialog for editing the skill levels can be opened by the dialog page
<a href="EditorSkillLevel">Skill levels of the agents</a> from the call center
model editor. In the dialog "Edit skill level" you can set up the individual
skill levels in the model.
</p>

<p>
Each skill level represents a set of skills to operate certain types of customers.
Each agent group has to be assigned a skill level.
</p>

<p>
By the buttons <b>Add skill</b> and <b>Remove skill</b> one can select whilch
individual skills should belong to a skill level.
</p>

<p>
Per client type these properties can be specified:
</p>

<h3><img src="../images/clock.png">&nbsp; Holding time distribution</h3>
<p>
If a client of the chosen type is served by an agent of this skill level, the actual
holding time is determined by the holding time distribution defined here.
</p>
<p>
This distribution can be set up global (for the whole day).
In addition, for each half-hour interval an individual
distribution can be defined. If "Use global distribution for this interval"
is selected, the global distribution will be used, otherwise the
individual distribution for this interval will be used.
</p>

<h3><img src="../images/clock.png">&nbsp; Post processing time distribution</h3>
<p>
If a client of the chosen type is served by an agent of this skill level, the actual
post processing time the agents needs before he is ready for the next client
will be determined by the post processing time distribution defined here.
</p>
<p>
This distribution can be set up global (for the whole day).
In addition, for each half-hour interval an individual
distribution can be defined. If "Use global distribution for this interval"
is selected, the global distribution will be used, otherwise the
individual distribution for this interval will be used.
</p>

<h3><img src="../images/wrench.png">&nbsp; Score</h3>
<p>
In each skill level for each client type which can be served by the agents of the
seleczed skill level a score value can be defined. The higher this value, the more
likely a waiting client will be routed to an agent of the selected skill level
(if there are free agents of different skill levels).
</p>

<p>
The agent score results from the skill level score together with the call center score
and the score, calculated from the idle time of the agent.
