Simulation &gt; Heuristic revenue improvement
</div>

<h1>Heuristic revenue improvement</h1>

<p>
The heuristic revenue improvement sucessively changed the numbers of agents in all intervals up and down and
checks if this improves the revenue. If the revenue gets higher, the changed agents number will be kept;
otherwise the original number of agents will be maintained.
</p>

<h3>Warning / notices</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Heuristic optimization:</b><br>
  The revenue improvement function is a heuristic optimization process which is not covering the whole solution space.
  Therefore it is very likely the function will only find a better but not the global optimal solution.</li>  
  <li><b>Search direction:</b><br>
  While searching the intervals are inspected in order. Because the individual intervals are links by forwarded
  clients and retryers, changed in one interval will influence other intervals, too. Therefore a solution found
  in the optimization proces can be changed again by starting the function again.</li>  
  <li><b>Long run time needed:</b><br>
  The revenue improvement process is very time consuming.</li>  
  <li><b>Many simulated days needed:</b><br>
  Please use a signifiant higher number of simulated days than the default value of 100 days. If using only 100 simulated
  days the deviation between two simulation runs has more impact on the results than the adding or removing of a single
  agent interval. Therefore the optimizer cannot determine if adding or removing an agent interval is or advantage or
  disadvantage. If using to few simulated days you will not get valid optimization results!</li>
</ul>

This function is also available via the <a href="Parameter.html">command line parameters</a>.
