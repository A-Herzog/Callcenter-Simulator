<h1>Batch processing</h1>

<p>
By using the function <b>Batch processing</b> the Callcenter Simulator can
perform multiple simulation runs in immediate succession.
There are two types of batch processing supported:
</p>

<h2>Process folder</h2>

<p>
In this mode a directory containing the model files to process has to be
specified. The simulator will try to simulate all <tt>xml</tt> files for which
there is no <tt>*_statistic.xml</tt> file as call center model files and will
store the statistic results as <tt>*_statistic.xml</tt> files in the same
directory.
</p>

<p>
This function is also available via the <a href="Parameter.html">command line parameters</a>.
</p>

<h2>Create parameter series</h2>

<p>
In this mode, the currently loaded call center model editor is simulated. But on each run of the
batch simulation one model parameter is changed in a specifed way so that at the end there are
statistic data of a series of simulations with a range of parameter values available.
The simulation results are stored in the directory specified in the form of statistic <tt>xml</tt>
output files. Please note that the results can also be can be written in a processed form
in a single file for multiple simulation runs (see the dialog "Additional output settings").
</p>

<h2>Dialog "Additional output settings"</h2>

<p>
In this dialog you can set up to run some <a href="Filter.html">output filter</a>
right after each simulation and to append the results to a single file.
By using this function a table continaing the results of the parameter series
can be created easily.
