<h1>Erlang C based agents preplanning</h1>

<p>
By using the Erlang C based agents preplanning, one can get an estimation
of the needed number of agents before starting the real optimization process.
This allows to reduce the number of needed optimization steps.
</p>

<p>
On the preplanning the number of agents is calculated for each client group
individually for matching the selected service targets. Following the partial
agent numbers are summed up to a complete model. This meand the Erlang C based
preplanning can lead to other numbers of agents than the simulation, in particular
in multi skill environments and when using model parameters which are not
covered by the Erlang C model.
