<h1>Dialog "Create new model with wizard"</h1>

<p>
The dialog for creating new call center models is opened from the menu item "New model with wizard"
of the "File" menu. In this dialog you can create a call center model for
simulation in just a few steps. The model can be expanded successively later via the model editor.
</p>

<h2>Page 1 of 4: Caller</h2>
<p>
On this dialog page you can specify how many clients will average per half-hour interval.
In contrast to the options on the further dialog pages there are no ready to use default values
for this property.
</p>

<h2>Page 2 of 4: Waiting time tolerance of the clients</h2>
<p>
If the clients only have a limited waiting time tolerance (which is the normal case),
you can set up here the waiting time tolerance as well as the probability for a retry
after waiting cancelation.
</p>

<h2>Page 3 of 4: Forwarding</h2>
<p>
In many cases clients can not be fully served  by an single agent after and therefore need
to be forwarded to another agent. On this dialog page you can specify which part of the
clients will be forwarded after a conversation.
</p>

<h2>Page 4 of 4: Agents</h2>
<p>
Finally you can specify the average holding and post processing times.
Moreover you can set up indirectly the number of agents that are supposed to work
in the call center. By selecting a desired utilization of the agent the simulator 
calculates the number of needed agents from the client arrivals and the average
holding and post processing times. Because this estimation is not respecting the
fluctuations in the client arrival and in the actual holding and post processing
thimes, the workload that arises later from the simulation will not match the
desired value exactly.
