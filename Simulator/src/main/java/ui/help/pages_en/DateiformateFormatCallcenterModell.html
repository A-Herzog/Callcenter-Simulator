<h1>Documentation of the file formats of Callcenter Simulator - Call center models</h1>

<a href="Dateiformate.html">Back to the overview of all file formats</a>

<h2>File header</h2>

<p>
<tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>&lt;!DOCTYPE CallCenterModel SYSTEM "CallcenterSimulator_en.dtd"&gt;</tt>
</p>

<p>The root node for a call center model file is <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt>.</p>

<h2>General information</h2>

<p>
The <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt> node contains the following sub nodes
containing general information about the model.
Each of the sub nodes has to exist exactly once (if not specified in an other way):
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelSimulatorVersion&gt;</tt>: Stores the version of the simulator which was used to create the model.
  If here a larger value than the current version number of the simulator is noted, the simulator will warn
  the user when loading the model.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelName&gt;</tt>: Stores the name of the model.
  The name is used to allow the user to identify the model.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelDate&gt;</tt>: This node is optional. Stores the date for which the simulation model stands for.
  The format for the date is MM/DD/YYYY but local date formats will be recognized when loading the file.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelDescription&gt;</tt>: Stores a description of the model.
  The description can be used to store any information about the model for the user.</li>  
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelMaxQueueLength&gt;</tt>: Stores the maximum length of the queue length.
  If there are as many clients in the queue as specified here, new clients will be rejected.
  Clients that are already in operation talking to an agent are not counted.</li>  
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelSimulatedDays&gt;</tt>: Specifies the number of days to simulate in a simulation run.
  The more days are simulated, the more statistically stable the results will be.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelPreferredShiftLength&gt;</tt>:
  If agents groups are defined by the number of agents per half-hour interval and not in the form
  of a fixed number of agents with specific working hours, the specific agents have to be
  generated with specific working hours before the start of the simulation. In order to replicate
  the characteristics of the real call center system as realistic as possible, the agents are not
  scheduled with half-hour working hours, as this would lead to overlaps due to an overestimation
  of the real disposable working hours. Instead the simulator tries to generate agents with
  shift lengths specified here. This global default value can be overwritten by a data field with
  the same name per agents group.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelMinimalShiftLength&gt;</tt>:
  By using this optional element in addition to the <tt>&lt;ModelPreferredShiftLength&gt;</tt> element
  an minimal shift length for the agents can be defined. If this element is missing, an minimal shift
  length of one interval is assumed (what means no restriction on the minimal shift length are applied).
  This global default value can be overwritten by a data field with the same name per agents group.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelServiceLevel&gt;</tt>:
  During the simulation it is recorded, how many callers have reached the desired service level.
  The service level is the percentage of callers who do not had to wait longer than a certain number of seconds.
  In this node one be specify the number of seconds which should be set as the limit for the achievement of the service levels.</li>  
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelProductivity&gt;</tt>:
  In this node 48 values separated by ";" are expected that specify the agents productivity during the day.
  The available working agents per half-hour interval in agents groups that are defined via a a number of
  agents per half-hour interval or by modeling the clients arrival distribution is multiplied by this productivity value.
  This global productivity can optionally be overridden per call center and per agents group.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelDiseaseRelatedSurchage&gt;</tt>:
  In this node 48 values separated by ";" are expected that specify how much higher the number of
  agents in planning should compared to those used in the model during the day.
  The available working agents per half-hour interval in agents groups that are defined via a a number of
  agents per half-hour interval or by modeling the clients arrival distribution is multiplied by this
  surcharge value and stored in the statistics. The value itself will not be used for the simulation.
  This global surcharge can optionally be overridden per call center and per agents group.</li>   
</ul>

<h2>Client types</h2>

<p>
The <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt> node can have any number (but at least one) sub nodes of the type
<tt>&lt;ModelClientType&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Attributes of the <tt>ModelClientType</tt> node</h3>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>Name</tt>: Stores the name of the client types. This name is e.g. used in the definition
  of the skill levels. The <tt>Name</tt> attribut is required.</li>
  <li><tt>Active</tt>: Specifies if the current client type should be used in the simulation.
  <tt>Active</tt> can have the values 0 and 1. The attribute is optional; if it is missing,
  "1" will be assumed.</li>
  <li><tt>BlocksLine</tt>: Specifies if clients of the current type will need
  a phone line while waiting (which is the case for calls but for example not for mails).
  The attribute is optional; if it is missing, "1" will be assumed.</li>
  <li><tt>ServiceLevel</tt>: If this optional node exists, the value specified here
  will be used when recording the service level for this client type in the
  statistics instead of the global value.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sub nodes of the <tt>ModelClientType</tt> node</h3>

<p>
The <tt>&lt;ModelClientType&gt;</tt> node contains the following sub nodes.
Each of the sub nodes has to exist exactly once:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsFreshCalls&gt;</tt>: This node contains the two sub nodes
  <tt>FreshCallsCount</tt> and <tt>FreshCallsDistribution</tt>.
  <ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;FreshCallsCount&gt;</tt> specifies the number of fresh calls
    of clients of this type per day. As an optional parameter the node can get
    a <tt>StandardDeviation</tt> attribute defining the standard deviation
    (at a normal distribution) for the number of fresh calls per simulation day.
    If this attribute is missing, "0" is assumed.</li>
	<li><tt>&lt;FreshCallsDistribution&gt;</tt> contains 24, 48 or 96 values separated by ";"
	defining the number of fresh calls for this client type per hour, half-hour or
	15 minutes intervall. The actual absolut value of the values is not important, but only
	the relative ratio of the magnitudes of the values with each other. The total number of
     fresh calls of this type of clients is determined by the node  <tt>FreshCallsCount</tt>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsScore&gt;</tt>: This node has no content itself but has three attributes:
  <tt>Base</tt>, <tt>PerWaitingSeond</tt> and <tt>Forwarding</tt>.
  The three attributes store the base score for the client type, the value the score
  will be increased per waiting second and the score increasement if a client of this
  type is forwarded.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceDistribution&gt;</tt>:
  <i>Either this node or the node <tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceDistributionLong&gt;</tt>
  or the node <tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceEstimation&gt;</tt> has to exist. Several simultaneously are not permitted.</i><br>
  In this element a distribution is stored, according to which the waiting time tolerances of the clients are determined.
  If empirical data are specified, the data will be scaled to a total duration of one hour.</li>  
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceDistributionLong&gt;</tt>:
  <i>Either this node or the node <tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceDistribution&gt;</tt>
  or the node <tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceEstimation&gt;</tt> has to exist. Several simultaneously are not permitted.</i><br>
  In this element a distribution is stored, according to which the waiting time tolerances of the clients are determined.
  If empirical data are specified, the data will be scaled to a total duration of 10 days.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceEstimation&gt;</tt>:
  <i>Either this node or the node <tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceDistribution&gt;</tt>
  or the node <tt>&lt;ClientsWaitingTimeToleranceDistributionLong&gt;</tt> has to exist. Several simultaneously are not permitted.</i><br>
  This element has no content, but the following three attributes:
  <tt>WaitingTime</tt>, <tt>CancelRate</tt> and <tt>Correction</tt>.
  The <tt>WaitingTime</tt> attribute stores a time in the form <tt>hh:mm:ss.nnn</tt> and gives the average waiting time of the clients.
  The <tt>CancelRate</tt> attribute specifies the measured cancel rate from which the waiting time tolerance is to be extrapolated.
  The <tt>Correction</tt> attribute specifies how much the projected waiting time tolerance should be adjusted upwards or downwards
  and takes a time value in the form <tt>hh:mm:ss.nnn</tt> or <tt>-hh:mm:ss.nnn</tt>.
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsRetry&gt;</tt>:
  This node has to contain exactly the following nine sub nodes:
  <ul> 
    <li><tt>&lt;RetryIntervalDistribution&gt;</tt>:
    Stores the distribution used to describe the intervals between canceling a call and starting a new call.</li>
    <li><tt>&lt;RetryProbabilityAfterBeingBlockedFirstRetry&gt;</tt>:
    Specifies the probability for a first retry of a client after being blocked (due to no more waiting space).</li>    
    <li><tt>&lt;RetryProbabilityAfterBeingBlockedFurtherRetrys&gt;</tt>:
    Specifies the probability for a second, third, etc. retry of a client after being blocked (due to no more waiting space).</li>
    <li><tt>&lt;RetryProbabilityAfterCanceledFirstRetry&gt;</tt>:
    Specifies the probability for a first retry of a client after canceling waiting.</li>
    <li><tt>&lt;RetryProbabilityAfterCanceledFurtherRetrys&gt;</tt>:
    Specifies the probability for a second, third, etc. retry of a client after canceling waiting.</li>
    <li>The four nodes <tt>&lt;RetryClientTypeAfterBeingBlockedFirstRetry&gt;</tt>,
    <tt>&lt;RetryClientTypeAfterBeingBlockedFurtherRetrys&gt;</tt>,
    <tt>&lt;RetryClientTypeAfterCanceledFirstRetry&gt;</tt> und
    <tt>&lt;RetryClientTypeAfterCanceledFurtherRetrys&gt;</tt> has to have a
    <tt>&lt;RetryNewClientType&gt;</tt> sub node for each client type.    
    <tt>&lt;RetryNewClientType&gt;</tt> has a <tt>Name</tt> attribute which describes
    for which client type the change rate is to be used and in its content specifies
    the rate at which the type of a client changes on a retry to this client type.
    If all <tt>&lt;RetryNewClientType&gt;</tt> nodes contain "0",
    no client type change will be performed on a retry.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsForwarding&gt;</tt>: This node has to have a <tt>Probability</tt> attribute,
  which gives the probability that clients of this type get forwarded after a conversation.
  If this forwarding probability is larger than 0, this node has to have one or more sub nodes
  of the type <tt>ForwardingNewClientType</tt>, that specify how the client type changes on forwarding.
  Additionally the <tt>ClientsForwarding</tt> node can have one or more
  <tt>ForwardingSkillLevelDepending</tt> sub nodes overwriting the default forwarding rules by
  rules depending on the skill level of the agent who served th client.
  <ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;ForwardingNewClientType&gt;</tt>: This node has to have a <tt>Name</tt> paraneter,
    specifying which new client type clients of this type can get on forwarding.
    As content of this node the rate at which forwarding to this client type happens has to be specified.
    (The rate has to be a non-negative number which can be larger than 1. The probability for forwarding to
    this client type is calculated by dividing the rate by the sum of all rates.)</li>
	<li><tt>&lt;ForwardingSkillLevelDepending&gt;</tt>: This node works nearly the same way as the node
	<tt>ClientsForwarding</tt>. It has a <tt>Probability</tt> attribute and any number of
	<tt>ForwardingNewClientType</tt> sub nodes. But additionly it has to be defined by a <tt>SkillLevel</tt> attribute
	for which skill level this rule should apply. After a conversation first is checked if there is a
	<tt>ForwardingSkillLevelDepending</tt> rule matching to the skill level of the agent who served the client.
	If yes, this rule is used to determine if the client is forwarded and which client type he should get.
	If not, the default rules defined in <tt>ClientsForwarding</tt> are used.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ClientsRecall&gt;</tt>: This node has to have a <tt>Probability</tt> attribute,
  which gives the probability that clients of this type start a second call after being successfully served.
  If this recall probability is larger than 0, this node has to have a <tt>RecallIntervalDistribution</tt>
  sub node describing the recall interval distribution and one or more sub nodes
  of the type <tt>RecallNewClientType</tt>, that specify how the client type changes on recalling.
  Additionally the <tt>ClientsRecall</tt> node can have one or more
  <tt>RecallSkillLevelDepending</tt> sub nodes overwriting the default recalling rules by
  rules depending on the skill level of the agent who served th client.
  <ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;RecallIntervalDistribution&gt;</tt>: Specifies the the distribution of distances between
    the end of a conversation and another call from the same client.</li>    
    <li><tt>&lt;RecallNewClientType&gt;</tt>: This node has to have a <tt>Name</tt> paraneter,
    specifying which new client type clients of this type can get on recalling.    
    As content of this node the rate at which recalling to this client type happens has to be specified.
    (The rate has to be a non-negative number which can be larger than 1. The probability for forwarding to
    this client type is calculated by dividing the rate by the sum of all rates.)</li>
    <li><tt>&lt;RecallSkillLevelDepending&gt;</tt>: This node works nearly the same way as the node
    <tt>ClientsRecall</tt>. It has a <tt>Probability</tt> attribute and any number of
    <tt>RecallNewClientType</tt> sub nodes. But additionly it has to be defined by a <tt>SkillLevel</tt> attribute
    for which skill level this rule should apply. After a conversation first is checked if there is a
    <tt>RecallSkillLevelDepending</tt> rule matching to the skill level of the agent who served the client.
    If yes, this rule is used to determine if the client is starting a recall later and which client type he should get then.
    If not, the default rules defined in <tt>ClientsRecall</tt> are used.</li>
  </ul></li> 
  <li><tt>&lt;YieldPerClient&gt;</tt>: As content of this node has to be specified how much a successfully serviced
  client of this type is worth.</li>  
  <li><tt>&lt;CostPerCaller&gt;</tt>: This node has to have the following two attributes:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Canceling</tt>: Stores the (virtual) costs incurred by a waiting canceling.</li>
    <li><tt>WaitingSecond</tt>: Stores the (virtual) costs incurred per second waiting.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Call centers and agents</h2>

<p>
The <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt> node can have any number (but at least one) sub nodes of the type 
<tt>&lt;ModelCallCenter&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Attributes of the <tt>ModelCallCenter</tt> node</h3>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>Name</tt>: Stores the name of the call center. The <tt>Name</tt> attribut is required.</li>
  <li><tt>Active</tt>: Specifies if the current call center should be used in the simulation.
  <tt>Active</tt> can have the values 0 and 1. The attribute is optional; if it is missing,
  "1" will be assumed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sub nodes of the <tt>ModelCallCenter</tt> node</h3>

<h4>General information</h4>

<p>
Each <tt>ModelCallCenter</tt> node has to have one of each of the following nodes as sub nodes:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>&lt;CallCenterTechnicalFreeTime&gt;</tt>: This node stores the technical free time, the time needed
  to route the client to an available agent. Optional this node can have a <tt>IsWaitingTime</tt> attribute 
  which can have the values 0 or 1. If the attribute is missing "1" is assumed as value.
  In this case the technical free time is perceived by the clients as waiting time, which means that they
  still can cancel waiting during this period.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;CallCenterScore&gt;</tt>: This node contains the base score of the call center which is used
  for calculating the score of an agent.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsScore&gt;</tt>: This node has to contain the two sub nodes <tt>AgentsScoreFactorSinceLastCall</tt>
  und <tt>AgentsScoreFactorFreeTimePart</tt>. Both sub nodes have to contain a number value that describes at which magnitude
  the free time of an agent since the last call and the free time part of an agent (in percent) is to be used when calculating
  the agents score.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Optional each <tt>ModelCallCenter</tt> node can contain any of the following nodes in each case exactly one:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelProductivity&gt;</tt>:
  In this node 48 values separated by ";" are expected that specify the agents productivity during the day.
  The available working agents per half-hour interval in agents groups that are defined via a a number of
  agents per half-hour interval or by modeling the clients arrival distribution is multiplied by this productivity value.
  If this node is missing the global value will be used.
  This call center depending productivity can optionally be overridden per agents group.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelDiseaseRelatedSurchage&gt;</tt>:
  In this node 48 values separated by ";" are expected that specify how much higher the number of
  agents in planning should compared to those used in the model during the day.
  The available working agents per half-hour interval in agents groups that are defined via a a number of
  agents per half-hour interval or by modeling the clients arrival distribution is multiplied by this
  surcharge value and stored in the statistics. The value itself will not be used for the simulation.
  If this node is missing the global value will be used.
  This call center depending surcharge can optionally be overridden per agents group.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Minimum waiting times</h4>

<p>
Optional each <tt>&lt;ModelCallCenter&gt;</tt> node can contain one <tt>&lt;CallCenterMinimumWaitingTime&gt;</tt> sub node.
</p>

<p>
Each <tt>&lt;CallCenterMinimumWaitingTime&gt;</tt> node can have any number of <tt>&lt;MinimumWaitingTimeClientType&gt;</tt> sub nodes.
Each <tt>&lt;MinimumWaitingTimeClientType&gt;</tt> node defines a minimum waiting time for an individual client type for the current call center.
(The mimimum waiting time is the mimimum time a client needs to have waited before he can routed to an agent in the call center for which this time is defined.)
The client type for which the minimum waiting time is to apply has to be specified by the <tt>Name</tt> attribute.
The waiting time itself is specified as a number fo seconds as the content of the <tt>&lt;MinimumWaitingTimeClientType&gt;</tt> node.
</p>

<h4>Agents groups</h4>

<p>
Each <tt>&lt;ModelCallCenter&gt;</tt> node has to have one or more <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> sub nodes.
Each <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> node describes an agents group with some common properties in the current call center.
</p>

<p>
Each <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> node can have an <tt>Active</tt> attribute which can have the values 0 or 1.
The attribute is optional; if it is missing, "1" will be assumed. The attribute specifies if the current agents group
 should be used in the simulation.
</p> 

<p>
Agents groups can either have a fixed number of agents and a duty time interval or a distribution of agents working
per half-hour over the day or to model the fresh calls distribution of several client types with the agents distribution:
</p> 

<ul class="big"> 
  <li><b>Agents with fixed working hours:</b><br>
  In this case the <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> node has to contain a <tt>&lt;AgentsGroupCount&gt;</tt> sub node defining the
  size of the agents group and  a <tt>&lt;AgentsGroupWorkingTimeBegin&gt;</tt> sub node defining the start working time.
  Addtionally a <tt>&lt;AgentsGroupWorkingTimeEnd&gt;</tt> sub node can be added setting up the end of the working time of the agents group.
  If this sub node is missing, the agents are working until the end of the simulated day.</li>
  <li><b>Agent group from predetermined agents distribution:</b><br> 
  In this case the <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> node has to contain a <tt>&lt;AgentsGroupDistribution&gt;</tt> sub node which
  has to contain 24, 48 or 96 values separated by semicolons. Each value stands for the number of agents in one hour, half-hour or 15 minutes interval.
  The simulator generates specific agents at the start of simulation from these values. On shift planning the preferred shift length
  given in a number of half-hour intervals by the optional node <tt>&lt;ModelPreferredShiftLength&gt;</tt> is used.
  In additional by using the <tt>&lt;ModelMinimalShiftLength&gt;</tt> element a minimal shift length can be defined.
  If one or both of these nodes does not exist, the values from the nodes with the same names in the <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt> node are used.  
   Additionally the <tt>&lt;AgentsGroupDistribution&gt;</tt> node can have a <tt>LastShiftIsOpenEnd</tt> attribute. If this attribute
   exists and has the value "1", the agents which are planned to work until midnight will continue working until no more clients are in the system.</li>  
  <li><b>Distribution over the day according to the client arrivals:</b><br>
  In this case the <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> node has to contain a <tt>&lt;AgentsGroupByClientArrivals&gt;</tt> sub node.
  This sub node has an <tt>AgentsHalfHours</tt> attribute defining how many agents half-hours are available for being planned.
  Additionally it will have one or more <tt>&lt;ByClientArrivalsGroup&gt;</tt> sub nodes. The distribution of the available
  agents working hours will be done by the client arrivals of one or more client types. For each client type to be respected
  there has to be a <tt>&lt;ByClientArrivalsGroup&gt;</tt> sub node. The name of the client type is stored as the content of
  the node and the rate at which this client type should be respected when calculating the distribution is stored in an attribute
  with the name <tt>Rate</tt>.  
  The simulator generates specific agents at the start of simulation from these values. On shift planning the preferred shift length
  given in a number of half-hour intervals by the optional node <tt>&lt;ModelPreferredShiftLength&gt;</tt> is used. 
  If this nodes does not exist, the value from the node with the same name in the <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt> node is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Regardless of how the working hours of the agents of the group are defined, each <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> node will have
each one of the two following sub nodes:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>&lt;AgentsGroupSkillLevel&gt;</tt>: As text content of this node the skill level of the agents of this group has to be specified.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;CostsPerHour&gt;</tt>: The content of this element describes how expensive an hour of work of an agent of this type is.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Optional each <tt>CallCenterAgentsGroup</tt> node can contain any of the following nodes in each case exactly one:
</p>

<ul class="big">
<li><tt>&lt;ModelProductivity&gt;</tt>:
  In this node 48 values separated by ";" are expected that specify the agents productivity during the day.
  The available working agents per half-hour interval in agents groups that are defined via a a number of
  agents per half-hour interval or by modeling the clients arrival distribution is multiplied by this productivity value.
  If this node is missing the global value will be used.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;ModelDiseaseRelatedSurchage&gt;</tt>:
  In this node 48 values separated by ";" are expected that specify how much higher the number of
  agents in planning should compared to those used in the model during the day.
  The available working agents per half-hour interval in agents groups that are defined via a a number of
  agents per half-hour interval or by modeling the clients arrival distribution is multiplied by this
  surcharge value and stored in the statistics. The value itself will not be used for the simulation.
  If this node is missing the global value will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally each <tt>&lt;CallCenterAgentsGroup&gt;</tt> node can have any number of
<tt>&lt;CostsPerClientType&gt;</tt> sub nodes. Each <tt>&lt;CostsPerClientType&gt;</tt> node has to have the following three attributes:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>ClientType</tt>: Specifies on which type of clients this node is related to.</li>  
  <li><tt>PerCall</tt>: Costs per call for the specified client type</li>
  <li><tt>PerMinute</tt>: Cost per conversation and post processing minute for the specified client type</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skill level</h2>

<p>
The <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt> node can have any number (but at least one) sub nodes of the type
<tt>&lt;ModelSkillLevel&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Attributes of the <tt>ModelSkillLevel</tt> node</h3>

<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>Name</tt>: Stores the name of the skill level. The <tt>Name</tt> attribut is required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sub nodes of the <tt>ModelSkillLevel</tt> node</h3>

<p>
Each <tt>&lt;ModelSkillLevel&gt;</tt> node has to have a <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientType&gt;</tt> sub node for
each client type agents of this skill level should be able to handle.
</p>

<p> 
Each <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientType&gt;</tt> node has to have a <tt>Name</tt> attribute describing to which
client type the working and post processing times specified in the sub nodes of this node are related to.
Each <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientType&gt;</tt> node has to have each one of the following sub nodes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypeHoldingTimeDistribution&gt;</tt>:
  Defines the holding times distribution for clients of the type specified in the
  <tt>Name</tt> attribute or the <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientType&gt;</tt> node
  when served by agents of the current skill level.
  In addition to the mandatory global <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypeHoldingTimeDistribution&gt;</tt> node further
  <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypeHoldingTimeDistribution&gt;</tt> elements with <tt>Interval</tt> attributes  
  can be specified. These elements stand for one of the 48 half-hour intervals (numbered from 1 to 48) and override the global value.</li>
  
  
  <li><tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypeHoldingTimeAddOn&gt;</tt>:
  Contains a mathematical expression describing a time value added to the holding time
  in dependence to the waiting time of the clients of the type specified in the
  <tt>Name</tt> attribute or the <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientType&gt;</tt> node
  when served by agents of the current skill level. In the expression the variable "w"
  is used for the waiting time of the clients in seconds.  
  In addition to the mandatory global <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypeHoldingTimeAddOn&gt;</tt> node further
  <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypeHoldingTimeAddOn&gt;</tt> elements with <tt>Interval</tt> attributes  
  can be specified. These elements stand for one of the 48 half-hour intervals (numbered from 1 to 48) and override the global value.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypePostProcessingTimeDistribution&gt;</tt>:
  Defines the post processing times distribution for clients of the type specified in the
  <tt>Name</tt> attribute or the <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientType&gt;</tt> node
  when served by agents of the current skill level.
  In addition to the mandatory global <tt>&lt;SkillLevelKundentypNachbearbeitungszeitverteilung&gt;</tt> node further
  <tt>&lt;SkillLevelKundentypNachbearbeitungszeitverteilung&gt;</tt> elements with <tt>Interval</tt> attributes  
  can be specified. These elements stand for one of the 48 half-hour intervals (numbered from 1 to 48) and override the global value.</li>  
  <li><tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientTypeScore&gt;</tt>:
  Defines the score value agents of the current skill level should get for serving clients of the type specified
  in the <tt>Name</tt> attribute of the <tt>&lt;SkillLevelClientType&gt;</tt> node.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Warning thresholds</h2>

<p>
The <tt>&lt;CallCenterModel&gt;</tt> node can optionally have one sub nodes of the type
<tt>&lt;ModelThresholds&gt;</tt>. The <tt>&lt;ModelThresholds&gt;</tt> element again can
have any number of <tt>&lt;ThresholdData&gt;</tt> sub nodes.
</p>

<h3>Attributes of the <tt>ThresholdData</tt> node</h3>

<p>
The following attributes are required:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>Type</tt>: Defines the type of the threshold. This attribute can have one of the following values:
  <ul>
    <li>Waiting time on call basis</li>
    <li>Waiting time on client basis</li>
    <li>Residence time on call basis</li>
    <li>Residence time on client basis</li>
    <li>Accessibility on call basis</li>
    <li>Accessibility on client basis</li>
    <li>Service level in call basis, based on all calls</li>
    <li>Service level in call basis, based on successful calls</li>
    <li>Service level in client basis, based on all clients</li>
    <li>Service level in client basis, based on successful clients</li>
    <li>Workload</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><tt>Intervals</tt>: Defines which intervals should be taken into account for the warning threshold. If "Average" is specified,
  the average value over the whole day is used. If "Each" is specified, the threshold should be kept in each interval. Alternatively
  48 values "0" or "1" can be given, specifying the half-hour intervals in which the threshold value should be kept.
  </li>
  <li><tt>Groups</tt>: Defines which client groups or call centers should be taken into account for the warning threshold. If "Average" is specified,
  the average value over all groups is used. If "Each" is specified, the threshold should be kept for each group. Alternatively
  the name of a client group or a call center can be given.
  </li>
  <li><tt>WarningYellow</tt>:
  Defines the value which will rise a yellow warning if its undershot (accessibility, service level and work load) or if its exceeded
  (waiting time and residence time). The threshold values for the waiting and the residence times are specified as times.
  The thresholds for all other types are specified as probabilites.
  </li>
  <li><tt>WarningRed</tt>:
  Defines the value which will rise a red warning if its undershot (accessibility, service level and work load) or if its exceeded
  (waiting time and residence time). The threshold values for the waiting and the residence times are specified as times.
  The thresholds for all other types are specified as probabilites.
  </li>
</ul>
