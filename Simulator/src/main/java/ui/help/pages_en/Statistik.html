<h1>Statistic viewer</h1>

<p>
The statistics viewer is displayed immediately after the end of a simulation run.
It represents all the data collected in the simulation process.
</p>

<p>
On the left side of the window a tree structure is visible listing all available 
topics. If one of these topics is clicked, the data for this topic appears on the right pane.
The function "Filter" above the tree structure allows to select which nodes
are to be displayed in the tree structure.
</p>

<p>
Statistic data can also be saved and loaded later. This is particularly
useful when the actual simulation was run on some other computer
for example in the <a href="Parameter.html">command line mode</a>.
</p>

<p>
By clicking the toolbar icon <b>Model for this results</b> the call center model
on which the simulation based on can be displayed and also be loaded into the
editor again.
