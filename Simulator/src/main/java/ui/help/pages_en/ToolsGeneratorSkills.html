<h1>Dialog "Load skill data"</h1>

<p>
The "Load skill data" dialog allows to load the holding and post processing time distributions
for the agents of an individual skill level for all client types at once from a table.
</p>

<p>
At first in the field <b>Table file</b> the name of a file from which the data is to be loaded
has to be specified. The combo boxes below <b>Distribution</b>
allows to select which table row to use for which holding or post processing time for which skill.
</p>

<h2>Structure of the table file</h2>

<p>
To load the holding and post processing time distributions of multiple skills from a spreadsheet file,
it has to have a certain structure. The holding or post processing time distribution for a skill consists of
at maximum 3600 numbers that indicate the density of the selected distribution on seconds basis.
These numbers has to be in the table in contiguous rows of a column.
In each column, the data of an individual group of agents can be stored.
If multiple groups of agents should be loaded at once, the table has to contain multiple data columns.
The columns do not need to be next to each other but all column data areas have to start in the same line.
All non-empty rows above the first row containing a numbers are interpreted as column headers.
The column headers are displayed below the caption <b>Table column</b>. If there is no non-number
value cell above the numerical cells, the column is names like the column letter
(e.g. "Column A", "Column B" etc.).
