<h1>Variance analysis</h1>

<p>
To get statistically stable simulation results many days have to be simulated.
Since the time required for the entire simulation linearly increases with the number
of simulated days, no more than necessary days should be simulated. By means of analysis
of variance it can be determined how much the results of individual simulations of the same model
differ between the simulation runs. If the results vary to greatly, the number of simulated days is too small.
</p>

<h2>Fixed number of simulated days</h2>
<p>
In this mode several simulation runs are carried out with the current model
with the configurated number of simulated days. The results of each run and
information on the variance between the runs are displayed in the table.
</p>

<h2>Variable number of simulated days</h2>
<p>
In this mode the number of simulated days is increased at each step by 5 starting with 5.
With any number of simulated days, a series of simulation runs is performed.
The coefficient of variation between the different simulation runs is displayed
in tabular form and in the form of a chart. This allows to see up to which number of
simulated days the coefficient of variation between different simulations decreases
significantly.
