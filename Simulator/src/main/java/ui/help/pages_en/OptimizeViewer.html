<h1>Optimizer results</h1>

<p>
An optimization run consists of a series of simulation runs, each with a slightly modified
call center model. As result of an optimization process typically the results of a single
run are of less interest; much more interesting is the change in the key parameters of a
simulation from simulation run to simulation run. Exactly this information is provided by
the optimization results viewer.
</p>

<p>
On the left side of the window, a tree structure is shown listing all available topics.
If one of these topics is selected, the corresponding data will appear on the right half
of the window.
</p>

<p>
The optimization results data can also be saved and viewed later via the menu item
<b>Show optimization results</b> of the Simulation menu. Furthermore the results of a single
simulation run can be displayed by clicking the toolbar button <b>Results of a single simulation run</b>.
This function also allows to load a selected model into the model editor.
