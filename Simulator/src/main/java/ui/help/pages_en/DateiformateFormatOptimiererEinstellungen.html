<h1>Documentation of the file formats of Callcenter Simulator - optimizer settings</h1>

<a href="Dateiformate.html">Back to the overview of all file formats</a>

<h2>File header</h2>

<p>
<tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>&lt;!DOCTYPE OptimizerSetup SYSTEM "CallcenterSimulator_en.dtd"&gt;</tt>
</p>

<p>The root node for an optimizer setup file is <tt>&lt;OptimizerSetup&gt;</tt>.</p>

<h2>Optimizer setup</h2>

<p>
Each optimizer settings file needs to contain each of the following items, unless otherwise stated:
<ul class="big">
  <li><tt>&lt;Optimizer-Property&gt;</tt>: The content of this node describes which property is to
  be optimized. It can contain the following values: <tt>Accessibility(CallBasis)</tt>, <tt>Accessibility(ClientBasis)</tt>,
  <tt>WaitingTime(CallBasis)</tt>, <tt>WaitingTime(ClientBasis)</tt>, <tt>HoldingTime(CallBasis)</tt>,
  <tt>HoldingTime(ClientBasis)</tt>, <tt>ServiceLevel(CallBasis;Successful)</tt>, <tt>ServiceLevel(CallBasis;All)</tt>,
  <tt>ServiceLevel(ClientBasis;Successful)</tt>, <tt>ServiceLevel(ClientBasis;All)</tt> or <tt>WorkLoad</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;Optimizer-Value&gt;</tt>: Deptending on the content of the <tt>&lt;Optimizer-Property&gt;</tt> node
  this node has to store a probability or a time.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;Optimizer-ValueMaximum&gt;</tt>: This optional node allows to define a second limit to the size value to be optimized.
  When optimizing the number of agents the value first is increased until the primary target is completed.
  Then, if necessary, the number of agents is reduced again to meet these secondary border.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;Optimizer-Intervals&gt;</tt>: This node can have one of the following values as content:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Average</tt>: The target value needs only to be achieved on average over the day. This means that all callers have the same weight.</li>
    <li><tt>Individual</tt>: The target has to be achieved in each half-hour interval. This means that at intervals with only a few callers these
    callers will have a bigger impact on the optimization process.<li>
	<tt>InOrder</tt>: The target has to be achieved in each half-hour interval. Moreover, the optimization is done at interval by interval,
	i.e. the agent numbers in an interval is only be adjusted if the target value has already been achieved in all previous intervals.
	In this method the time for the entire optimization process significantly larger. The advantage is that it cannot happen that the
	optimizer adds to many agents to an interval which are then not needed because the number of retryers gets reduced due to changes in
	the previous intervals.</li>
  </ul></li>  
  <li><tt>&lt;Optimizer-Groups&gt;</tt>: This node can have one of the following values as content:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Average</tt>: The target has to be achieved on average over all client types or call centers.</li>
    <li><tt>All</tt>: The target has to be achieved by each individual client types and each call center.</li>
    <li><tt>Selection</tt>: The target has to be achieved by the client types or call centers specified by
    <tt>&lt;Optimizer-Group&gt;</tt> nodes.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><tt>&lt;Modification-Value&gt;</tt>: Specifies the percentage of how much the number of agents is to be raised in each optimization step.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;Modification-Groups&gt;</tt>: This node can have one of the following values as content:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>All</tt>: In each optimization step all agents groups will be changed in the corresponding intervals.</li>
    <li><tt>Selection</tt>: In each optimization step the agents groups specified in the <tt>&lt;Modification-Group&gt;</tt>
    nodes will be changed in the corresponding intervals.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><tt>&lt;Optimization-InitialInventory&gt;</tt>: This node is optional.  
  The <tt>&lt;Optimization-InitialInventory&gt;</tt> node can have any number of
  <tt>&lt;Optimization-InitialInventoryClientType&gt;</tt> sub nodes. Each
  <tt>&lt;Optimization-InitialInventoryClientType&gt;</tt> node has to have a <tt>Name</tt> attribute
  defining for which client type this node should be used and has to have a non-negative integer number
  as content defining how many additional fresh call as manual carry over should be added to the simulation model.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;Restriction-Group&gt;</tt>: This node is optional.
  There can be any number of <tt>&lt;Restriction-Group&gt;</tt> elements. Each has to have the three attributes
  <tt>Name</tt>, <tt>Minimum</tt> and <tt>Maximum</tt>. Each <tt>&lt;Restriction-Group&gt;</tt> element
  describes the restrictions during the optimization for the number of agents in the agents group denoted by 
  the <tt>Name</tt> attribute. <tt>Minimum</tt> and <tt>Maximum</tt> has to contain each 48 values separated by ";",
  describing the minimum and the maximum number of agents per half-hour interval.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally there can be an <tt>&lt;Optimizer-OptimizationIntervals&gt;</tt> sub node in the <tt>&lt;OptimizerSetup&gt;</tt> node.
If this sub node exists, it has to contain 48 values separated by ";". The values can be "0" or "1", defining which
intervals are to be respected during optimization. If this sub node is missing, all intervals are used in the optimization.
</p>

<p>
If the <tt>&lt;Optimizer-Groups&gt;</tt> node has the content <tt>Selection</tt>,
the client types or call centers for which the target value should be reached have to by
specified by <tt>&lt;Optimizer-Group&gt;</tt> nodes. (For each client type or call center to be 
respected there has to be an <tt>&lt;Optimizer-Group&gt;</tt> node containing the name of the
client type or the call center.)
</p>

<p>
If the <tt>&lt;Modification-Groups&gt;</tt> node has the content <tt>Selection</tt>,
the agents groups to be changed have to be specified by <tt>&lt;Modification-Group&gt;</tt> nodes.
(For each agents groups to be changes there has to ba a <tt>&lt;Modification-Group&gt;</tt> node
containing the name of the agents group.)
</p>

<p>
Additionally there can be an <tt>&lt;Optimization-CarryOver&gt;</tt> sub node in the <tt>&lt;OptimizerSetup&gt;</tt> node.
This sub node specifies from which statistic file the carry over from the previous day is to be loaded. (If there is no
<tt>&lt;Optimization-CarryOver&gt;</tt> node or if this node does not have a <tt>StatisticFile</tt> attribute, no carring over
is done.) The <tt>&lt;OptimizerSetup&gt;</tt> node can have any number of <tt>&lt;VerknuepftUebertrag&gt;</tt> sub nodes.
For the use of the <tt>&lt;VerknuepftUebertrag&gt;</tt> nodes see the <a href="DateiformateFormatVerknuepfteSimulation.html">documentation</a>
of the connected simulation modells.
