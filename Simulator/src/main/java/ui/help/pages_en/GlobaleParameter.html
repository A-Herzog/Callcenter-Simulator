<h1>Dialog "Global parameters"</h1>

<p>
The following settings are available in the dialog "Global parameters":
</p>

<h3>Maximum queue length</h3>
<p>
Clients for whom not immediately a suitable free agent is available at their call, need to
enter the waiting queue. In most real call centers enough phone lines are available, so that the maximum
queue length is never exhausted. By artificially reducing the resource "waiting room" some key parameters
of the system can be controlled: If there are only very few waiting places available (and therefore often
clients are rejected, i.e. getting a busy signal) the remaining clients will have shorter waiting times.
</p>
<p>
Optionally the size of the waiting room can be specified depending on the number of active agents.
In the input box <a href="Parser.html">arithmetic instructions</a> can be entered and the number of active agents can
be accessed by the variable "a".
</p>
<p>
In the simulation only on a new incoming call (fresh calls and repeaters) a check for available waiting
space is done. If all available places in the queue are occupied, new calls will be rejected. Forwarded
calls may always enter the queue. When calculating the used waiting places only the actually waiting
clients are taken into account. Customers currently served by an agent do not occupy a waiting room.
</p>
<p>
As general rule it can be derived from the formula of Little that the available waiting room should be
at least as large as the product of the maximum arrival rate (in clients per second) and the maximum
waiting time that should occure (in seconds) when no customers are to be rejected because of lack of
waiting room.
</p>

<h3>Number of days to be simulated</h3>
<p>
The quality of the simulation resulsts is essentially determined by the number of simulated days.
The larger this value is, the closer the mean values from the simulation will be to the real
expected values of. The <a href="Statistik.html">statistics page</a> "Confidence intervals"
offers information about how much the results of simulation day to simulation day
vary an in which intervals the real mean values will be with which probability.
</p>
<p>
At low work loads 50 simulation days will be enough for stable results.
At high work loads 200 repetitions should be selected.
</p>

<h3>Preferred shift length</h3>
<p>
In the simulation specific agents are used with fixed working hours.
If the working time of an agent ends during a talk or a post-processing time,
the agent will finish his current task but will not be available for subsequent
incoming task anymore. In practice, however, often not the working times of
individual agents are available as input parameters for the simultion. It is
only known how many agents per half-hour interval were available.
Based on this information the simulator has to create individual agents for the
simulation. If agents with half-hour shifts would be used, the real available
working time would be overestimated, because the agents will finish their last
task at the end of the half-hour interval , while the agents of the next half-hour
interval will already start working. To avoid this effect, the simulator tries
to create agents with longer working hours, i.e. the simulator will create
shift plans which should be quite close to the real shift plans.
</p>
<p>
In this input field one can set up how long the working hours of an agent should
be at maximum. The simulator then will try to generate as long as possible
agents shifts respecting the required number of agents per interval and the
defined maximum shift length.
</p>

<h3>Minimum shift lengths</h3>
<p>
In addition to the preferred (maximum) shift length can a minimal shift length,
which has to be respected in the planning of the agents, can be defined. If a 
minimum shift length is defined, may there will be more agents scheduled than
specified for the agents group to respect the minimum shift length conditions.
It is not recommended to use minimum shift lengths.
</p>

<h3>Time span for service level</h3>
<p>
As output parameters of a queueing system often not only the average waiting time
and the accessibility are used but also the service level. Therefore a waiting
time is defined which should not be exceeded by as many as possible clients.
This  waiting time is often chosen to be 10, 20 or 30 seconds.
It then is asked what percentage of clients has waited this long at most.
In this box it can be set up which waiting time the simulator should
use for calculating the service level.
</p>

<h3>Agent groups productivity</h3>
<p>
In this dialog one can set how much of the specified agent working time
will actually be available. The data refer to all agents groups which
are not defined by fixed working hours. It can be selected that the agents
will always be available as specified, that they are only available for
a certain fixed proportion or that the availability will vary from
half-hour interval to half-hour interval. The global settings one can
make here can optionally be overwritten per call centers and per agents group.
</p>

<h3>Disease-related surcharge</h3>
<p>
In this dialog one can set up how much agents should be added for planning
to the number of agents defined in the model to compensate disease-related
leave. The resulting increased number of agents is not used in the simulation,
but is also displayed in the statistics. The data refer to all agent groups
which are not defined by fixed working hours. It can be selected that no
surcharge should be planned, a fixed percentage of surchare or that the 
surcharge should vary from half-hour interval to half-hour interval.
The global settings one can make here can optionally be overwritten per
call centers and per agents group.

<h2><img src="../images/Ampel_klein.png">&nbsp;Dialog "Thresholds"</h2>

<p>
By clicking the "Thresholds" button you can open the <a href="ThresholdWarnings.html">Thresholds warnings</a>
dialog which allows to define threshold values for some key performance indicators. If these threshold values
are exceeded or undershot, you will get a warning in the <a href="Statistik.html">statistic results</a>.
